<p>
15 And it came to pass that I beheld that the wrath of God was poured out upon that great and abominable church, insomuch that there were wars and rumors of wars among all the nations and kindreds of the earth.
</p>
<p>
16 And as there began to be wars and rumors of wars among all the nations which belonged to the mother of abominations, the angel spake unto me, saying: Behold, the wrath of God is upon the mother of harlots; and behold, thou seest all these things—
</p>
<p>
17 And when the day cometh that the wrath of God is poured out upon the mother of harlots, which is the great and abominable church of all the earth, whose founder is the devil, then, at that day, the work of the Father shall commence, in preparing the way for the fulfilling of his covenants, which he hath made to his people who are of the house of Israel.

Here, the wrath of God is directed at a corrupt institution, not at individuals. Reminds me of the distinction between "their creeds are all an abomination" and not "their [churches] are an abomination" (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.19?lang=eng&clang=eng#p19">JSH 1:19</a>).
</p>
<p>
The wrath of God is described as being "poured out" and being "upon". This seems to have less to do with God's emotions, and more to do with just consequences.

<p>
85 That their souls may escape the wrath of God, the desolation of abomination which awaits the wicked, both in this world and in the world to come. Verily, I say unto you, let those who are not the first elders continue in the vineyard until the mouth of the Lord shall call them, for their time is not yet come; their garments are not clean from the blood of this generation."
</p>
<p>
94 And another angel shall sound his trump, saying: That great church, the mother of abominations, that made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, that persecuteth the saints of God, that shed their blood—she who sitteth upon many waters, and upon the islands of the sea—behold, she is the tares of the earth; she is bound in bundles; her bands are made strong, no man can loose them; therefore, she is ready to be burned. And he shall sound his trump both long and loud, and all nations shall hear it.
</p>
<p>
106 And again, another angel shall sound his trump, which is the seventh angel, saying: It is finished; it is finished! The Lamb of God hath overcome and trodden the wine-press alone, even the wine-press of the fierceness of the wrath of Almighty God.

<p>Here, the Lord gives an explicit definition of the phrase "wrath of God": it is "the desolation of abomination which awaits the wicked, both in this world and in the world to come."
</p>
<p>We tend to think of "desolation" as "destruction". That is one of its meanings, but its deeper roots are about rendering something barren, lifeless, or empty. Some meanings of "desolate" that I found online:
</p>
<ul>
<li>To make lonely, forlorn, or wretched. To overwhelm with grief. Companionless. Lonely. Abandoned. Lost to shame. (<a href="https://www.wordnik.com/words/desolate">Wordnik</a>)</li>
<li>Joyless, disconsolate, and sorrowful through or as if through separation from a loved one. To deprive of inhabitants. (<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/desolate">Merriam-Webster</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The word "abomination" is also notable. We tend to view it as an extremely sinful behavior, and that is not wrong. But the essence is that it triggers disgust, revulsion, or loathing.</p>
<p>Thus, the Lord's definition of "wrath of God" is: <em>the condition of barren, wretched loneliness and shame that separates one from love, due to a disgust or revulsion about sinful behavior</em>. It is exactly what Alma described in <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/27.28,29?lang=eng&clang=eng#p27-p29">Mosiah 27:27-29</a>.</p>

<td>24 But they hardened their hearts and could not endure his presence; therefore, the Lord in his wrath, for his anger was kindled against them, swore that they should not enter into his rest while in the wilderness, which rest is the fulness of his glory.</td>
<td>God takes an oath of inevitable consequences because of His wrath. The consequences are an inability to enter the promised land, find peace/rest, and enjoy the fulness of God's glory.</td>

<td><p>1 Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;</p>
<p>2 And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.</p>
<p>3 But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;</p>
<p>4 Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.</p>
<p>5 For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</p>
<p>6 Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.</p>
<p>7 Be not ye therefore partakers with them.</p>
</td>
<td>Hurtful behaviors and willfulness to sin inevitably bring upon the disobedient the wrath of God, which prevents them from receiving an inheritance in the kingdom of God. We "partake" of the wrath of God instead of partaking of the sweetsmelling savour of Jesus's sacrifice. and we become children of disobedience instead of children of Christ.</td>

<td>
35 Behold, the Lord esteemeth all flesh in one; he that is righteous is favored of God. But behold, this people had rejected every word of God, and they were ripe in iniquity; and the fulness of the wrath of God was upon them; and the Lord did curse the land against them, and bless it unto our fathers; yea, he did curse it against them unto their destruction, and he did bless it unto our fathers unto their obtaining power over it.
</td>
<td>WOG is connected to just consequences for deep wickedness -- particularly applying it to people living in a promised land who were unworthy of that blessing. Nephi describes the wrath of God as a condition or experience more than as simply an elicited emotion. Time scale = long (WOG unfolds more over lifetimes or generations than over a single event).</td>

<td>1 And it came to pass that Enoch continued his speech, saying: Behold, our father Adam taught these things, and many have believed and become the sons of God, and many have believed not, and have perished in their sins, and are looking forth with fear, in torment, for the fiery indignation of the wrath of God to be poured out upon them.</td>
<td>WOG associated with perishing in sins. Notice that people are looking for this -- not so much that God imposes it, as that they themselves expect (demand?) it. I am reminded of Alma's description of his deep repentance experience.</td>

<td>
<p>11 And the angel spake more things unto me, which were heard by my brethren, but I did not hear them; for when I heard the words—If thou wilt be destroyed of thyself, seek no more to destroy the church of God—I was struck with such great fear and amazement lest perhaps I should be destroyed, that I fell to the earth and I did hear no more.</p>

<p>12 But I was racked with eternal torment, for my soul was harrowed up to the greatest degree and racked with all my sins.</p>

<p>13 Yea, I did remember all my sins and iniquities, for which I was tormented with the pains of hell; yea, I saw that I had rebelled against my God, and that I had not kept his holy commandments.</p>

<p>14 Yea, and I had murdered many of his children, or rather led them away unto destruction; yea, and in fine so great had been my iniquities, that the very thought of coming into the presence of my God did rack my soul with inexpressible horror.</p>

<p>15 Oh, thought I, that I could be banished and become extinct both soul and body, that I might not be brought to stand in the presence of my God, to be judged of my deeds.</p>

<p>16 And now, for three days and for three nights was I racked, even with the pains of a damned soul.</p>

<p>17 And it came to pass that as I was thus racked with torment, while I was harrowed up by the memory of my many sins, behold, I remembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world.</p>

<p>18 Now, as my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who am in the gall of bitterness, and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death.</p>

<p>19 And now, behold, when I thought this, I could remember my pains no more; yea, I was harrowed up by the memory of my sins no more.</p>

<p>20 And oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold; yea, my soul was filled with joy as exceeding as was my pain!</p>

<p>21 Yea, I say unto you, my son, that there could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were my pains. Yea, and again I say unto you, my son, that on the other hand, there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy.</p>
</td>
<td>This is a perfect description of someone who is experiencing the wrath of God. Notice how different it is from external condemnation. All the condemnation that Alma reports comes from himself. That does not make it any less severe -- perhaps the opposite.</td>

<p>33 For they are vessels of wrath, doomed to suffer the wrath of God, with the devil and his angels in eternity;</p>
<hr>
<p>104 These are they who suffer the wrath of God on earth.</p>
<p>105 These are they who suffer the vengeance of eternal fire.</p>
<p>106 These are they who are cast down to hell and suffer the wrath of Almighty God, until the fulness of times, when Christ shall have subdued all enemies under his feet, and shall have perfected his work;</p>
<p>107 When he shall deliver up the kingdom, and present it unto the Father, spotless, saying: I have overcome and have trodden the wine-press alone, even the wine-press of the fierceness of the wrath of Almighty God.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Verse 33 describes sons of perdition, whereas verse 104-106 describe those who have lived a telestial law but who nonetheless are not actively seeking to crucify Christ afresh. The difference in consequence is that sons of perdition suffer the wrath of God into eternity, whereas those of a telestial order suffer the wrath of God on earth and until Christ's work is done.</p>
<p>The phrase "vessels of wrath" is suggestive of harboring wrath inside. Wrath isn't just an external reaction on God's part; it is very much as a torment that proceeds from and lives within one's own heart.</p>
<p>Verse 107 compares WOG to a wine-press. This is a place where work is done by crushing and treading down, ultimately producing something valuable. God's wrath has a redemptive effect, after much effort.</p>

<td><p>12 And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with candles, and punish the men that are settled on their lees: that say in their heart, The LORD will not do good, neither will he do evil.</p>
<p>13 Therefore their goods shall become a booty, and their houses a desolation: they shall also build houses, but not inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, but not drink the wine thereof.</p>
<p>14 The great day of the LORD is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly, even the voice of the day of the LORD: the mighty man shall cry there bitterly.</p>
<p>15 That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness,</p>
<p>16 A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, and against the high towers.</p>
<p>17 And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against the LORD: and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as the dung.</p>
</td>
<td><p>It seems here that the day of wrath is a day when men are confronted with their own behavior &mdash; they must face the fact that they have sinned against the Lord.</p><p>The physical destruction ("blood poured out as dust, and their flesh as the dung", "their goods a booty, their houses a desolation") is perhaps a necessary trigger, but is not the real specter that the Lord is concerned about &mdash; it's just the one that has the most confrontive power for the wicked, because they will be forced to acknowledge the pointlessness and powerlessness of their choices. They cannot be happy on their terms. But it is the lack of happiness &mdash; not the temporary external symptoms of it &mdash; that is the real problem.</p></td>

<td><p>3 And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?</p><p>
4 Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?</p><p>
5 But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;</p><p>
6 Who will render to every man according to his deeds:</p><p>
7 To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:</p><p>
8 But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,</p><p>
9 Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;</p></td>
<td>A key phrase here seems to be "treasurest up unto thyself wrath" in a day that includes the "revelation of the righteous judgment of God." When God's righteousness is revealed rather than hidden, the wickedness of man will be recognizable, even to those who have lied to themselves very deeply. The reaction will be "indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish." I'm not sure that the wrath will be an emotion emerging from God's heart so much as it will be an emotion emerging from the heart of those who have treasured that wrath up unto themselves.</td>

<p>
15 And it came to pass that I beheld that the wrath of God was poured out upon that great and abominable church, insomuch that there were wars and rumors of wars among all the nations and kindreds of the earth.
</p>
<p>
16 And as there began to be wars and rumors of wars among all the nations which belonged to the mother of abominations, the angel spake unto me, saying: Behold, the wrath of God is upon the mother of harlots; and behold, thou seest all these things—
</p>
<p>
17 And when the day cometh that the wrath of God is poured out upon the mother of harlots, which is the great and abominable church of all the earth, whose founder is the devil, then, at that day, the work of the Father shall commence, in preparing the way for the fulfilling of his covenants, which he hath made to his people who are of the house of Israel.

Here, the wrath of God is directed at a corrupt institution, not at individuals. Reminds me of the distinction between "their creeds are all an abomination" and not "they [churches] are an abomination" (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.19?lang=eng&clang=eng#p19">JSH 1:19</a>).
</p>
<p>
The wrath of God is described as being "poured out" and being "upon". This seems to have less to do with God's emotions, and more to do with just consequences.

<p>
85 That their souls may escape the wrath of God, the desolation of abomination which awaits the wicked, both in this world and in the world to come. Verily, I say unto you, let those who are not the first elders continue in the vineyard until the mouth of the Lord shall call them, for their time is not yet come; their garments are not clean from the blood of this generation."
</p>
<p>
94 And another angel shall sound his trump, saying: That great church, the mother of abominations, that made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, that persecuteth the saints of God, that shed their blood—she who sitteth upon many waters, and upon the islands of the sea—behold, she is the tares of the earth; she is bound in bundles; her bands are made strong, no man can loose them; therefore, she is ready to be burned. And he shall sound his trump both long and loud, and all nations shall hear it.
</p>
<p>
106 And again, another angel shall sound his trump, which is the seventh angel, saying: It is finished; it is finished! The Lamb of God hath overcome and trodden the wine-press alone, even the wine-press of the fierceness of the wrath of Almighty God.

<p>Here, the Lord gives an explicit definition of the phrase "wrath of God": it is "the desolation of abomination which awaits the wicked, both in this world and in the world to come."
</p>
<p>We tend to think of "desolation" as "destruction". That is one of its meanings, but its deeper roots are about rendering something barren, lifeless, or empty. Some meanings of "desolate" that I found online:
</p>
<ul>
<li>To make lonely, forlorn, or wretched. To overwhelm with grief. Companionless. Lonely. Abandoned. Lost to shame. (<a href="https://www.wordnik.com/words/desolate">Wordnik</a>)</li>
<li>Joyless, disconsolate, and sorrowful through or as if through separation from a loved one. To deprive of inhabitants. (<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/desolate">Merriam-Webster</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The word "abomination" is also notable. We tend to view it as an extremely sinful behavior, and that is not wrong. But the essence is that it triggers disgust, revulsion, or loathing.</p>
<p>Thus, the Lord's definition of "wrath of God" is: <em>the condition of barren, wretched loneliness and shame that separates one from love, due to a disgust or revulsion about sinful behavior</em>. It is exactly what Alma described in <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/27.28,29?lang=eng&clang=eng#p27-p29">Mosiah 27:27-29</a>.</p>

<td>24 But they hardened their hearts and could not endure his presence; therefore, the Lord in his wrath, for his anger was kindled against them, swore that they should not enter into his rest while in the wilderness, which rest is the fulness of his glory.</td>
<td>God takes an oath of inevitable consequences because of His wrath. The consequences are an inability to enter the promised land, find peace/rest, and enjoy the fulness of God's glory.</td>

<td><p>1 Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;</p>
<p>2 And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.</p>
<p>3 But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;</p>
<p>4 Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.</p>
<p>5 For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</p>
<p>6 Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.</p>
<p>7 Be not ye therefore partakers with them.</p>
</td>
<td>Hurtful behaviors and willfulness to sin inevitably bring upon the disobedient the wrath of God, which prevents them from receiving an inheritance in the kingdom of God. We "partake" of the wrath of God instead of partaking of the sweetsmelling savour of Jesus's sacrifice. and we become children of disobedience instead of children of Christ.</td>

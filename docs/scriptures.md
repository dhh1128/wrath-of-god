<p>
15 And it came to pass that I beheld that the wrath of God was poured out upon that great and abominable church, insomuch that there were wars and rumors of wars among all the nations and kindreds of the earth.
</p>
<p>
16 And as there began to be wars and rumors of wars among all the nations which belonged to the mother of abominations, the angel spake unto me, saying: Behold, the wrath of God is upon the mother of harlots; and behold, thou seest all these things—
</p>
<p>
17 And when the day cometh that the wrath of God is poured out upon the mother of harlots, which is the great and abominable church of all the earth, whose founder is the devil, then, at that day, the work of the Father shall commence, in preparing the way for the fulfilling of his covenants, which he hath made to his people who are of the house of Israel.

Here, the wrath of God is directed at a corrupt institution, not at individuals. Reminds me of the distinction between "their creeds are all an abomination" and not "they [churches] are an abomination" (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.19?lang=eng&clang=eng#p19">JSH 1:19</a>).
</p>
<p>
The wrath of God is described as being "poured out" and being "upon". This seems to have less to do with God's emotions, and more to do with just consequences.

<p>
85 That their souls may escape the wrath of God, the desolation of abomination which awaits the wicked, both in this world and in the world to come. Verily, I say unto you, let those who are not the first elders continue in the vineyard until the mouth of the Lord shall call them, for their time is not yet come; their garments are not clean from the blood of this generation."
</p>
<p>
94 And another angel shall sound his trump, saying: That great church, the mother of abominations, that made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, that persecuteth the saints of God, that shed their blood—she who sitteth upon many waters, and upon the islands of the sea—behold, she is the tares of the earth; she is bound in bundles; her bands are made strong, no man can loose them; therefore, she is ready to be burned. And he shall sound his trump both long and loud, and all nations shall hear it.
</p>
<p>
106 And again, another angel shall sound his trump, which is the seventh angel, saying: It is finished; it is finished! The Lamb of God hath overcome and trodden the wine-press alone, even the wine-press of the fierceness of the wrath of Almighty God.

<p>Here, the Lord gives an explicit definition of the phrase "wrath of God": it is "the desolation of abomination which awaits the wicked, both in this world and in the world to come."
</p>
<p>We tend to think of "desolation" as "destruction". That is one of its meanings, but its deeper roots are about rendering something barren, lifeless, or empty. Some meanings of "desolate" that I found online:
</p>
<ul>
<li>To make lonely, forlorn, or wretched. To overwhelm with grief. Companionless. Lonely. Abandoned. Lost to shame. (<a href="https://www.wordnik.com/words/desolate">Wordnik</a>)</li>
<li>Joyless, disconsolate, and sorrowful through or as if through separation from a loved one. To deprive of inhabitants. (<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/desolate">Merriam-Webster</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The word "abomination" is also notable. We tend to view it as an extremely sinful behavior, and that is not wrong. But the essence is that it triggers disgust, revulsion, or loathing.</p>
<p>Thus, the Lord's definition of "wrath of God" is: <em>the condition of barren, wretched loneliness and shame that separates one from love, due to a disgust or revulsion about sinful behavior</em>. It is exactly what Alma described in <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/27.28,29?lang=eng&clang=eng#p27-p29">Mosiah 27:27-29</a>.</p>

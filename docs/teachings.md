All organized bodies have their peculiar evils, weaknesses and difficulties, the object is to make those not so good reform and return to the path of virtue that they may be numbered with the good, and even hold the keys of power, which will influence to virtue and goodness—should chasten and reprove, and keep it all in silence, not even mention them again; then you will be established in power, virtue, and holiness, and the wrath of God will be turned away.

<td>Were the wicked, in their sins, under the necessity of walking into the presence of the Father and Son, hand in hand with those who believe that all will be saved—that Jesus will leave none, their condition would be more excruciating and unendurable [p. 154a]than to dwell in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone. <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/19.20?lang=eng#p19">Rev 19:20</a> The fatalist's doctrine consigns to hell the infant not a span long, while the adulterer, whoremonger, thief, liar, false swearer, murderer, and every other abominable character, if they but repent on the gallows or their deathbeds, are, by the same doctrine, forced into the presence of the Father and the Son, which, could they enter there, would be a hell to them....
How many kingdoms there are has not been told to us: they are innumerable. The disciples of Jesus were to dwell with him. Where will the rest go? Into kingdoms prepared for them, where they will live and endure. Jesus will bring forth, by his own redemption, every son and daughter of Adam, except the sons of perdition, <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.43?lang=eng#p42">D&C 76:43</a> who will be cast into hell. Others will suffer the wrath of God <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.10?lang=eng#p9">D&C 76:10</a> will suffer all the Lord can demand at their hands, or justice can require of them; and when they have suffered the wrath of God till the utmost farthing is paid, <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/5.26?lang=eng#p25">Matt 5:26</a> they will be brought out of prison. Is this dangerous doctrine to preach? Some consider it dangerous; but it is true [p. 154b] that every person who does not sin away the day of grace, <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/2.15?lang=eng#p14">Morm 2:15</a> and become an angel to the Devil, <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/3.11?lang=eng#p10">Jacob 3:11</a> will be brought forth to inherit a kingdom of glory.

<td>The wrath of God is here equated with "all the Lord can demand at [the wicked's] hands, or justice can require of them" and creates an exquisite misery in the hearts of the wicked until the uttermost farthing is paid.</td>

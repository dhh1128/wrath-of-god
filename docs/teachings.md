<td>The great misery of departed spirits in the world of spirits, where they go after death, is to know that they come short of the glory that others enjoy and that they might have enjoyed themselves, and they are their own accusers.</td>

All organized bodies have their peculiar evils, weaknesses and difficulties, the object is to make those not so good reform and return to the path of virtue that they may be numbered with the good, and even hold the keys of power, which will influence to virtue and goodness—should chasten and reprove, and keep it all in silence, not even mention them again; then you will be established in power, virtue, and holiness, and the wrath of God will be turned away.

<td>A willingness to forgive others and withhold criticism will turn away the wrath of God.</td>

<td>Were the wicked, in their sins, under the necessity of walking into the presence of the Father and Son, hand in hand with those who believe that all will be saved—that Jesus will leave none, their condition would be more excruciating and unendurable [p. 154a]than to dwell in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone. <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/19.20?lang=eng#p19">Rev 19:20</a> The fatalist's doctrine consigns to hell the infant not a span long, while the adulterer, whoremonger, thief, liar, false swearer, murderer, and every other abominable character, if they but repent on the gallows or their deathbeds, are, by the same doctrine, forced into the presence of the Father and the Son, which, could they enter there, would be a hell to them....
How many kingdoms there are has not been told to us: they are innumerable. The disciples of Jesus were to dwell with him. Where will the rest go? Into kingdoms prepared for them, where they will live and endure. Jesus will bring forth, by his own redemption, every son and daughter of Adam, except the sons of perdition, <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.43?lang=eng#p42">D&C 76:43</a> who will be cast into hell. Others will suffer the wrath of God <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.10?lang=eng#p9">D&C 76:10</a> will suffer all the Lord can demand at their hands, or justice can require of them; and when they have suffered the wrath of God till the utmost farthing is paid, <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/5.26?lang=eng#p25">Matt 5:26</a> they will be brought out of prison. Is this dangerous doctrine to preach? Some consider it dangerous; but it is true [p. 154b] that every person who does not sin away the day of grace, <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/2.15?lang=eng#p14">Morm 2:15</a> and become an angel to the Devil, <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/3.11?lang=eng#p10">Jacob 3:11</a> will be brought forth to inherit a kingdom of glory.

<td>The wrath of God is here equated with "all the Lord can demand at [the wicked's] hands, or justice can require of them" and creates an exquisite misery in the hearts of the wicked until the uttermost farthing is paid.</td>

<td><p>In speaking to Enoch, the Lord indicated that both the time of His birth and the time preceding His Second Coming would be “days of wickedness and vengeance.” 4  <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/mos/7.46,60?lang=eng#p45">Mos 7:46, 60</a> And the Lord has said that in the last days, wrath shall be poured out upon the earth without mixture. 5 [See <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/115.6?lang=eng#p5">D&C 115:6</a>] Wrath is defined both as the righteous indignation of God and as the very human instances of impetuous ardor and deep or violent anger. The former arises from the concern of a loving Father whose children are often “without affection, and they hate their own blood,” 6  <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/mos/7.33?lang=eng#p32">Mos 7:33</a> whereas the latter wrath arises from a people “without order and without mercy, … strong in their perversion.” 7  <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/9.18-19?lang=eng#p17">Moro 9:18-19</a> I fear the earth is experiencing both wraths, and I suspect the divine wrath is very much provoked by those who are stirring up the hearts of men to wickedness, slander, and violent hatreds.</p>

<p>The first casualties of human wrath are truth and understanding. James counseled that we be “swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath: For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.” 8 <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/james/1.19-20?lang=eng#p18">James 1:19-20</a> As Enoch observed, God’s throne is one of peace, justice, and truth. 9 [See <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/mos/7.31?lang=eng#p30">Mos 7:31</a> Whether they be false friends or unrighteous teachers, artists or entertainers, commentators or letter writers to local newspapers, seekers of power or wealth, beware of those who stir us up to such anger that calm reflection and charitable feelings are suppressed.</p></td>

<pre>15 Here he grieves; having passed away he grieves;
In both places the wrongdoer grieves.
He grieves; he is afflicted,
Having seen the stain of his own action.

17 Here he is tormented; having passed away he is tormented.
In both places the wrongdoer is tormented.
He is tormented, thinking, "I have done wrong."
Gone to a state of woe, he is tormented all the more.
